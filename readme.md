Teensy core support libraries for teensy3-toolchain

These file will generate the core support library for the teensy3 toolchain. I've based them on the official sources from Paul Stoffregen (the files are in https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/teensy3).
This library should have the bare minimum necessary for the teensy3 board (+ some USB comms stuff, for debugging), with no Arduino support planned. I might create a library which will contain the minimum required to support the Arduino, though.
